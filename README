libprereadshim

libprereadshim is a layer that can be inserted between the OS's system calls
and another program. It essentially attempts to solve the opposite problem as
libeatmydata: programs which make isolated, small reads.

An example of this problem is Firefox. Whenever a website is accessed, it will
check for a cookie or other such data, often spinning the HDD back up just for
a miniscule data access. (The other problem of Firefox fsync()ing A LOT should
be handled by libeatmydata.)

libprereadshim uses five methods to mitigate the read problem:

1. Programs usually use mostly the same files on each run. The first 8 MB (by
default) of files read by the program more than 15 (by default) seconds after
the program started are automatically read in when it starts.

2. Traversing one part of a directory usually results in traversing more of
it. Whenever a file is opened, its containing directory is iterated if it is
the first time that a file in that directory was opened.

3. Opening a file for reading usually indicates that the whole file will be
read at some point. When a file is opened for reading, data from the file (up
to 64 MB by default) is read before returning the file handle, the first time a
given file is opened.

4. Reading one file in a directory is usually followed by reading others (eg,
cookies in Firefox). When a file is openned for reading whose name matches a
configured pattern(s), other files in that directory will be read in the
background.

5. libprereadshim may be configured to deny the existence of files matching
certain patterns.

Dependencies:
  Just make and a C compiler. GNU Autotools as well if working directly from
  the git distribution.

Building:
  If configure does not exist in the project directory, first run
    autoreconf

  In either case, then run
    ./configure
    make

Installing:
  As root, run
    make install
  (on Ubuntu and such just run "sudo make install" as yourself)

Uninstalling:
  make uninstall
or
  sudo make uninstall


CONFIGURATION

The environment variable PREREADSHIM_DENY may be set to a colon-separated list
of glob patterns. If any file to be opened for reading matches any of the
patterns (see fnmatch(3)), libprereadshim will deny the file's existence. Files
which are opened for writing at any time are whitelisted and thereafter not
affected by this option. For example, specifying
  */Cache/?/*:*/OfflineCache/?/*
would prevent Firefox from reading old cache files.

The environment variable PREREADSHIM_READAHEAD indicates how many megabytes
should be read from each file opened for reading. If unset, it defaults to
64. Setting it to zero effectively disables readahead.
